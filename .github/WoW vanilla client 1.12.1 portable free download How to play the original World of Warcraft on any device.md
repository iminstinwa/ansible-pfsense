## Step 1: Download WoW Vanilla Client 1.12.1
  
The first step is to download WoW Vanilla Client 1.12.1 from a reliable source. You can use any WoW client to play, as long as it's version 1.12.1. Where you got it from doesn't really matter[^4^]. You can Google around for one, but we also provide some handy links for you to download it from:

- [Vanilla WoW Download (1.12.1 Client) - Your Gaming Dude](https://www.yourgamingdude.com/vanilla-wow-download-1-12-1-client) [^5^]

These clients are pre-installed so all you should need to do is extract them from the zip file and update your realmlist to the server of your choice.
  
## Step 2: Update Your Realmlist
  
The next step is to update your realmlist to the server of your choice. The realmlist is a file that tells the game client which server to connect to. You can find it in your WoW folder, under Data/enUS or Data/enGB, depending on your language. The file name is realmlist.wtf.
  
To update your realmlist, you need to open the file with a text editor, such as Notepad, and replace the default line with the one provided by the server you want to play on. For example, if you want to play on Kronos, a popular Vanilla WoW private server, you need to change the line to:
  `set realmlist wow.kronos-wow.com`  
You can find the realmlist information for different servers on their websites or forums. Some examples are:

- [RetroWoW - How To Connect](https://retro-wow.com/page/connect)
- [VanillaGaming - How To Connect](https://vanillagaming.org/forum/index.php?topic=14169)

After you have updated your realmlist, save the file and close it.
  
## Step 3: Launch the Game and Enjoy
  
The final step is to launch the game and enjoy the classic WoW experience.
