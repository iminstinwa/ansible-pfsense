Assassin's Creed Rogue is a 2014 action-adventure game developed by Ubisoft Sofia and published by Ubisoft. It is the seventh major installment in the Assassin's Creed series, and acts as a sequel to 2013's Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag and a prequel to 2012's Assassin's Creed III.
 
One of the features of the game is the ability to customize the protagonist Shay Cormac's appearance with different outfits, some of which are based on previous Assassin's Creed protagonists such as Altair, Ezio, Connor, Edward and Arno. These outfits are called Legacy Outfits and are normally unlocked by playing other Assassin's Creed games on the same platform or by using Uplay points.

However, some players may not have access to these outfits or may want to unlock them without playing other games or spending Uplay points. In that case, there is a way to unlock them using a cheat table, which is a file that modifies the game's memory values using a program called Cheat Engine.

In this article, we will show you how to unlock Legacy Outfits in Assassin's Creed Rogue with a cheat table. Please note that this method is not endorsed by Ubisoft and may cause issues with your game or your account. Use it at your own risk.
 
## What You Need
 
- A copy of Assassin's Creed Rogue on PC.
- A program called Cheat Engine, which you can download from [cheatengine.org](https://cheatengine.org).
- A cheat table file for Assassin's Creed Rogue, which you can download from [fearlessrevolution.com](https://fearlessrevolution.com/viewtopic.php?t=1010). There are different versions of the cheat table, but we recommend using the V2 Unlocker version.
- An optional 100% save game file for Assassin's Creed Rogue, which you can download from [mediafire.com](http://www.mediafire.com/file/s9cz1zc9y6z7y7c/ACRogue.rar/file). This will allow you to access all the outfits without completing the game.

## What You Do

1. Launch Assassin's Creed Rogue and load your save game.
2. Go inside Shay's ship, the Morrigan.
3. Launch Cheat Engine and hook it to the game's executable file (ACRogue.exe).
4. Open the cheat table file that you downloaded and enable the Global Unlocker option by clicking on the square box next to it.
5. Go to the outfit section in the game menu and select an outfit. If it does not work, walk outside the ship and then walk back inside. This should refresh everything and unlock the outfits.
6. Enjoy your new outfits!
